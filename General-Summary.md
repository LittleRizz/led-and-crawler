Good Morning Alishah,

Wow, what a couple of days. It gave me the opportunity to see how I perform under the pressure of uncontrollable circumstances. I was humbled by what I still have to learn but I loved both the challenges as they both required extensive research which just sparked a fire in me. It gets easy to fall down the rabbit hole of always looking for better ways to write code for a certain problem.  I wish I had more time but I know that is the point of the challenge. I have so much to learn yet and I am hoping you will take all of my raw, untapped talent and mold me into a top-rated software engineer.  I am passionately looking forward to the opportunity to be educated and mentored.

The LED challenge I coded in JavaScript and HTML. I gave the optional challenge, The Web Crawl, a stab using both JavaScript and Java. I’ve attached an explanation of my process for both challenges along with the programming folders.

I feel like I gave it 120% and used so many different resources, from blogs, MDN’s docs, stackexchange, tutorials, even to using my mom to bounce ideas off of. It was fun trying to collaborate together via g-chat. I will definitely continue to explore these projects to fine tune them.

Thank you for this wonderful opportunity and I hope to hear back from you soon. See the attached files.

All the Best

~Drew
