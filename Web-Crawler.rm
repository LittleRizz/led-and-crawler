Web Crawler Challenge (Option)

I started this project creating a simple web crawler using JavaScript to see if I understood the process. I used a text editor called Atom. The goal of the crawler is to input a URL (Estey.com) in the crawler.js script, run it and it searches for all relative URL’s and for a specific word (stemming. I set a limit of 10 links before it reaches it max limit and the crawler stops. 

I was ready to begin the assigned technical challenge and I decided to use Java Eclipse and pair it up with MySQL to store the data. With the help of several blogs and tutorials I started to program a URL web crawling program but I ran out of time.

I created a package called WebCrawler in Eclipse and I initially was just using a tutorial to just learn how to crawl for words and links. I created two Java classes. Main.java and DB.java, but I haven’t had any time to test the script. I was then going to modify the code to crawl for absolute URL’s. I will definitely try to finish it on my own time.

I will attach their respective folders to the email.
